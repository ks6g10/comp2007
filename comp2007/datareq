Waypoint

The waypoint data facilitates the function of providing map coordinates to be displayed on the device and as a reference towards the device location.
Data is stored in the open format of GPS eXchange Format as it is higly compatible and translateble towards other mapping formats and applications.
The user must be able to view and modify the data in varius abstractions either through the device itself or by using the device as a usb slave peripheral.

The waypoint data is during operation considered read-only by the system, unless it is modified through user input.


Data Format: GPS eXchange Format
GPS eXchange Format(gpx) is a de facto standard for storing gps data.[ref]
Accessing capabilities:
User:
The database of waypoints must be stored in a visible partition allowing access for the user through the capabilities of slave usb mode,
 the entity should be read and writable.
System:
The system access the same entity as the user.

User Location or Track
Data Format: GPS eXchange Format



Data retention:  Major requirement,
